Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Bondhan Novandy, Indonesian and living in Depok, West-Java Indonesia.

I have been into programming since high school and currently working as IT Architect in one of the telecom companies in Indonesia.
In my "leasure" time I used to do PoCs on some of things which make me curious and of course with some $$ it will be more interesting ðŸ˜…
My programming languages are Go, Python, Java, C/C++ and assembly. 

My expertise are:
- EMV
- Smart Card/Java Card/Mifrare/Desfire cards
- Golang microservices
- Qt with C/C++
- Python for toolings
- ISO8583
- IT architecture/End2End Solutions Architect, some projects (on premise):
  1. API Gateways (Tyk & Krakend)
  2. Bank Gateway (Middleware Application)
  3. KeyCloak
  4. Prepaid Registration
  5. SDP
  6. Docker/Containerization
  7. Kubernetes
  8. etc.

I am opened for any collaborations which make impact. 

Thanks
