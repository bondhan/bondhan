Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bondhan Novandy, an Indonesian currently living in Depok, West Java.

I've been into programming since high school, and I'm currently working as an IT Architect at one of the telecom companies in Indonesia.  

In my **leisure** time, I enjoy doing proof-of-concepts (PoCs) on things that spark my curiosityâ€”and of course, it gets even more interesting with some ðŸ’° involved ðŸ˜….

Programming languages I use include Go, Python, Java, C/C++, and assembly.

**My areas of expertise:**
- EMV
- Smart Card / Java Card / Mifare / Desfire cards
- Golang microservices
- Qt with C/C++
- Python for tooling
- ISO8583
- Embedded Systems
- IT Architecture / End-to-End Solutions Architecture

**Some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on (on-premise) in the last 2 years:**
1. Bank Gateway (modernization from C++ mfino to Java Microservices)  
2. Camara Data Monetization (Keycloak + Tyk)
3. Prepaid Registration Modernization from Tibco to Microservices  
4. Emergency Credit
5. IT System Architecture review and capacity sizing
6. ...and more

I'm open to any collaboration that makes impact.

Thanks!
